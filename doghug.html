    <p>Dogs and people began living together 15,000 years ago when dogs followed peopleâ€™s migration throughout East Asia. The connection was natural because both people and dogs are social beings. Neither can thrive when alone, and both benefit mentally (and often physically) from strong social bonds</p>
